## üì£ Introduction

The goal of the project is to containerize a simple web application infrastructure using Docker Compose.

The project involves setting up three mandatory containers - a MariaDB database, an NGINX web server, and a WordPress instance.

By completing this project, I learned how to architect a production-like environment using Docker networking and persist data in volumes. The bonus services also allowed me to dig deeper into configuring real-world web applications.

Overall, Inception gave me valuable hands-on experience in understanding core Docker concepts that I will be able to apply in future projects and roles as a software engineer.

## üì¶ Installation

> [!WARNING]
> Before running the project, you must add a line inside `/etc/hosts`.

```
127.0.0.1   rbulanad.42.fr
```

Clone the repository from GitHub:
```sh
git clone https://github.com/RedWrks/Inception.git
```

Use the env.template to create the required .env
```sh
cp srcs/env.template srcs/.env
```

Build and run the `Inception` project containers:
```sh
make
```
> [!NOTE]
> This command will build the containers with docker-compose and run them.

## üìù Usage

Display each containers status:
```sh
make status
```

Stop the running containers:
```sh
make stop
```
> [!NOTE]
> The containers take their sweet time to shut down, if you are impatient use the classic CTRL-C during the shutdown process (at your own risk).

Purge and clean the containers:
```sh
make clean
```

The good ol' stop and clean:
```sh
make fclean
```
